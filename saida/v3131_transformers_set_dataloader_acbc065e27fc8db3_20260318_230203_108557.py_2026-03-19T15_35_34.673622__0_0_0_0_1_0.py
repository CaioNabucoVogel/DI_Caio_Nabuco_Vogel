    """
        A method that regroups all arguments linked to the dataloaders creation.

        Args:
            drop_last (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to drop the last incomplete batch (if the length of the dataset is not divisible by the batch
                size) or not.
            num_workers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
                Number of subprocesses to use for data loading (PyTorch only). 0 means that the data will be loaded in
                the main process.
            pin_memory (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether you want to pin memory in data loaders or not. Will default to `True`.
            persistent_workers (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                If True, the data loader will not shut down the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed
                once. This allows to maintain the workers Dataset instances alive. Can potentially speed up training,
                but will increase RAM usage. Will default to `False`.
            prefetch_factor (`int`, *optional*):
                Number of batches loaded in advance by each worker.
                2 means there will be a total of 2 * num_workers batches prefetched across all workers.
            auto_find_batch_size (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`)
                Whether to find a batch size that will fit into memory automatically through exponential decay,
                avoiding CUDA Out-of-Memory errors. Requires accelerate to be installed (`pip install accelerate`)
            ignore_data_skip (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the
                same stage as in the previous training. If set to `True`, the training will begin faster (as that
                skipping step can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training
                would have.
            sampler_seed (`int`, *optional*):
                Random seed to be used with data samplers. If not set, random generators for data sampling will use the
                same seed as `self.seed`. This can be used to ensure reproducibility of data sampling, independent of
                the model seed.

        Example:

        ```py
        >>> from transformers import TrainingArguments

        >>> args = TrainingArguments("working_dir")
        >>> args = args.set_dataloader(train_batch_size=16, eval_batch_size=64)
        >>> args.per_device_train_batch_size
        16
        ```
